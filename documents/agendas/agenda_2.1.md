## AGENDA for SEM Project meeting 2.1 - GROUP 06b

* Type: TA Meeting / <s>Group Meeting</s>
* Date: 24th November

# AGENDA Content
- [x] Meet with the TA

# Tasks
* Add agenda for the meeting on 1st December until 29th November 16:00
* Write requirements until the next meeting - preferably until 29th November at 16:00 to be checked by the TA
* Work on Assignment 1.1

# Next Meeting: 26th November 12:00 - Group Meeting

# General notes
* We need to decide how we want the agenda to be (maybe have the same as in OOP Project - with a chairman each week and some note-takers)
* Only the main branch matters -> the pipeline for the branch needs to always be working
* We should make a merge request every week on Tuesday before 16:00 from dev to main
* We should try to keep the git clean: useful dev and main, good commit titles, decent commit size
* We have to run the pipeline locally to check the functionality and not use GIT for this
* We will have mandatory meetings until 2.5 and an optional (maybe online) meeting in 2.6
* Be careful about work distribution, everyone needs to do at least a bit of everything
* Set goals from the beginning: we have decided 8 - 8.5 is a decent group grade
* When the template is published, we should focus on creating the necessary microservices and setting up the security between them
* No hard requirements on the database: H2 or MySQL are 2 examples
